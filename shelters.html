	<h2>Helping Out Animals in Shelters</h2>
	<p>Every year, as animal shelters find themselves crowded to capacity, over one hundred thousand pets are euthanized. Particularly since the pandemic - when many people were running to adopt pets they couldn't feasibly keep - America's animal shelters have been under imense pressure. Everywhere from the New York Times to the Gaurdian articles are being written about this crisis. These shelters can't go on without <i>you</i>. Your help, be it through donation or adoption, can mean the difference between a pet euthenised and one that finds a new home. And if you plan to adopt, do so resposibly. Irrisponsible adoption is dangerous to both owner and pet. Act conscientiously and you can help make your community a better place.

	<p><big>Adopting a pet,</big>though certainly a challenge, can be extremely benificial. From lowering blood pressure to being a fun compatriot in your day to
		day activities, it is no wonder that over <strong>one-hundred-million</strong> cats and dogs are owned in the United
		States. If you know that you can reasonably care for a pet, and are enthusiastic about doing so, go for it! You could make a lifelong friend and forever memories.</p>

	<big>Adding to Our Community</big>
	<p>New York animal shelters are overloaded with animals and low on vets. By enlisting the community we can offset the
		loss in lives. Look into your local animal shelter, and see if you can chip in. They will almost certainly welcome volunteers, supplies, or donations.
		Animal shelters are one of the most noble institutions we have, and its important we support them.
