  <h2>Caring for Animals</h2>
  <p>Both of us have always loved animals. From winning a goldfish at a carnival, to currently having 2 playful fun cats next to my computer right now, we care deeply about the many animals hurt by all forms of neglect. We created this website in part to participate in the hackathon but also to inform our community about the numerous animals in need of help. Adopting from a shelter is one of the most rewarding experiences one can have, and we want to spread this joy to both pet owners and pets. So, what are you waiting for, visit your local shelter today! </p>

    <h2>Seth's Personal Goal</h2>
    <p>My goal is to work professionally in cybersecurity. But more than just that, I want to be able to contribute to those around me, both humans and animals. I volunteer regularly at a local animal shelter near me, and I am always eager to teach others about our little furry friends. I believe it is of vital importance to get this information out their to the community, so that before a person adopts a pet they are prepared to take care of it entirely, and not abandon it when it may become challenging. After all, this challenge leads pet ownership to be such a satisfying process that benefits both the pet and the owner. One day I would like to start my own business, and I am certain I can use part of my profits to help animals and the community around me flourish. In invoking this cause I can give the community something to join together in, and nothing would make me happier. </p>

	<h2>Arthur's Personal Goal</h2>
	<p>My goal is to work in software engineering, and specifically would be working at a company like SpaceX or NASA,
		pioneering aerospace companies that's revolutionizing space exploration. As a software engineer at SpaceX or NASA,
		my role would be to develop cutting-edge software solutions that power the next generation of spacecraft. The work
		culture at SpaceX and NASA is characterized by a passion for pushing the boundaries of technology. The benefits and
		compensation at SpaceX and NASA are highly competitive, reflecting the company's appreciation for its employees'
		hard work and dedication. Beyond the financial rewards, the opportunity contribute to the advancement of space
		exploration would be incredibly rewarding. Financially, I can use what money I make to donate in charities I believe in like the numerous charities that support animal vets in ensuring that animals get the care they need.</p>
