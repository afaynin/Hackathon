	<h2>Arthur Goal</h2>
	<p>My goal is to work in software engineering, and specifically would be working at a company like SpaceX or NASA,
		pioneering aerospace companies that's revolutionizing space exploration. As a software engineer at SpaceX or NASA,
		my role would be to develop cutting-edge software solutions that power the next generation of spacecraft. The work
		culture at SpaceX and NASA is characterized by a passion for pushing the boundaries of technology. The benefits and
		compensation at SpaceX and NASA are highly competitive, reflecting the company's appreciation for its employees'
		hard work and dedication. Beyond the financial rewards, the opportunity contribute to the advancement of space
		exploration would be incredibly rewarding. </p>
	<p>I began my coding journey when I was 12, and was messing around with my computer, bored out of my mind. Suddenly
		I had the great idea of creating a game of my own, and decided to quickly learn the whole ‘coding’ thing in order
		to succeed in making a creation. While I certainly didn't learn the entirety of coding that night, it did begin my
		journey to learning as much of it as I can. This journey had paid off greatly as I have learnt to make things in a
		variety of different languages, such as mathematical models, statistical theorems visualizations, and even a few
		(crude) games. Now I look upon this journey not just as a tremendous hobby but as a large career opportunity in
		which I can sell my skills to improve the world around me. Not only that, but I can develop my own website, like
		this one, in order to make my internal manifestations a reality.</p>
