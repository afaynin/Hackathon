	<h2>Animals Without A Home</h2>
	<p>In the United States, homeless animals number in the millions. You may know of strays in your neighborhood - maybe one has crossed your path, or the pickings of a hungry animal has been spotted lying about. These animals deserve just as much respect as any pet. We as a community have to fight the cruelty shown in their abandonment. Talk to those at local animal shelters and see what you can do to help.</p>

	<big>Adopting Wisely</big>
	<p>Are you sure you can adopt and care for an animal? It is a very involved process, as you are letting another living
		creature into your life. </p>
	<p>Every year, over six million animals are abandoned or lost. Don't contribute to this statistic, adopt responsibly!

	<big>Community and Awareness</big>
	<p>When we inform other about the responsibiliity they have to accept when adopting a pet, we help ensure those pets
		aren't abandoned and left out in the streets. Together, we can make a difference. And should you ever feel you cannot care for your pet, <i>do not</i> abandon it. Look for a friend to take it, or see about returning your pet to a shelter. Many abandoned pets fail to survive as strays, and suffer immensily before they die. Don't put your pet through that. Adopt responsibly, return responsibly.</p>
